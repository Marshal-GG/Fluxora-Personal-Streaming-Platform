## Development Phases

### Phase 1 — Core Infrastructure
> **Goal:** Server boots, client connects on LAN, can stream a file

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| FastAPI server scaffolding | Must | `main.py`, routers, db setup |
| SQLite schema + migrations | Must | Initial schema |
| mDNS/Zeroconf LAN broadcast | Must | Server side |
| Flutter client project setup | Must | Clean Architecture structure |
| mDNS discovery in Flutter | Must | Client-side Dart |
| `GET /files` endpoint | Must | File browser API |
| File browser UI in Flutter | Must | Directory tree navigation |
| Basic FFmpeg HLS streaming | Must | Single quality stream |
| HLS playback in Flutter | Must | `better_player` / `media_kit` |

**Target:** Working LAN stream, file browser, basic connection

---

### Phase 2 — Auth, Library & Polish
> **Goal:** Secure pairing, media libraries with metadata, polished UI

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Client pairing + auth tokens | Must | `POST /auth/request-pair` flow |
| PC Control Panel (Flutter Desktop) | Must | Dashboard + client management |
| Library manager + scan API | Should | Directory indexing |
| TMDB metadata integration | Should | Movies + TV |
| Library UI in Flutter client | Should | Grid with posters |
| Playback resume (progress tracking) | Should | `stream_sessions` |
| UI design system + dark theme | Should | Final visual polish |

**Target:** Production-quality LAN experience with auth + library

---

### Phase 3 — Internet Streaming (WebRTC)
> **Goal:** Stream works when away from home

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| WebRTC signaling server | Must | WS `/ws/signal` |
| Flutter WebRTC integration | Must | `flutter_webrtc` |
| STUN/TURN configuration | Must | Google STUN + TURN server |
| Smart path selection (LAN vs WebRTC) | Must | Auto-switching logic |
| Connection quality monitoring | Should | Detect degradation, switch paths |

**Target:** Full remote streaming over internet

---

### Phase 4 — Monetization
> **Goal:** Tier system live, upgrade flows working

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Subscription tier enforcement | Must | DB + API middleware |
| License key / payment validation | Must | Integration TBD |
| Upgrade prompt UI | Should | In-app upsell |
| Free/Plus/Pro/Ultimate tier limits | Must | Stream concurrency, features |

**Tier Breakdown:**
| Tier | Price | Stream Limit | Features |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Free | $0 | 1 concurrent | File browser, basic streaming |
| Plus | $4.99/mo | 3 concurrent | Library, metadata, TMDB |
| Pro | $9.99/mo | 10 concurrent | AI org, hardware encode |
| Ultimate | $19.99/mo | Unlimited | All features, priority support |

---

### Phase 5 — Advanced Features
> **Goal:** Power user features for Pro/Ultimate tier

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hardware encoding (NVENC/VAAPI) | Nice-to-have | GPU transcoding for Pro |
| AI file organization | Nice-to-have | Auto-tag, rename, categorize |
| End-to-end encryption | Should | E2E for internet streams |
| Multi-user / family sharing | Nice-to-have | Shared library access |
| TV/casting support (Chromecast) | Nice-to-have | Future platform |
| iOS/Android background streaming | Should | Foreground service |
